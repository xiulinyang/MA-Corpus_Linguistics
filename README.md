# MA-Corpus-Linguistics
This is my project for the course Corpus Linguistics. I built a one-million charachter corpus to examine the Europeanization of Chinese. 

There are two files. The ```data_collection.py ``` is used for data randomization, while the ```parse_analysis.py``` is repsonsible for parsing and further statistic analysis. The whole corpus is put in the folder ```corpus```
